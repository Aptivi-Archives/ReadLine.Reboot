## What is ReadLine.Reboot?

ReadLine.Reboot is a reboot of Toni Solarin-Sodara's original ReadLine that is discontinued. It's a [GNU Readline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Readline) like library built in pure C#. It can serve as a drop in replacement for the inbuilt `Console.ReadLine()` and brings along with it some of the terminal goodness you get from Unix shells, like command history navigation and tab auto completion.
